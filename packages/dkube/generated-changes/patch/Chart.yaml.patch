-description: A Helm chart for Dkube product installation on kubernetes platform
-
-# A chart can be either an 'application' or a 'library' chart.
-#
-# Application charts are a collection of templates that can be packaged into versioned archives
-# to be deployed.
-#
-# Library charts provide useful utilities or functions for the chart developer. They're included as
-# a dependency of application charts to inject those utilities and functions into the rendering
-# pipeline. Library charts do not define any templates and therefore cannot be deployed.
